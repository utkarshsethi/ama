Hello!! My name is Utkarsh Sethi. You probably came to this repo by [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/utkarshsethi/) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/HsraktuIhtes).

If I've missed replying, this repo is the one dedicated place where you can ask me anything and I will reply to you. 


[![Ask Me Anything !](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ask%20me-anything-1abc9c.svg)](https://GitHub.com/utkarshsethi/ama) means *anything*. Personal. Money. Work. Life. Projects.
Cooking. Traveling. Cubing. Cycling. Pok√©mon. Whatever. :joy:
